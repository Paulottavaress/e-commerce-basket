Instructions:

Check the users.json file to get valid access credentials.
Both users already have some items added to their carts. If you checkout, these items will be deducted from the stock.
If you log out, and then log back in, the stock will be replenished.
In the .env.local you are able to turn off the API delay, increase or reduce it, and control the odds of a nternal Server error.

Notes:

The .env.local file is beeing pushed to the remote repository because this is not a production project.
The data folder mocks the DB tables, where passwords should be encrypted. For simplicity sake, I have not encrypted the passwords as this is not a production project.
The data has not been normalized in the UsersAPI, as I picture this type of application in a non relational DB, such as MongoDB.
I've added extras, like the login page, catch all page, and products list page. I've not implemented the recover password view/route and sign up view/route as well as the brute force login attempt prevention.
The shipping method with the lowest price will set as the default and updated to whenever the selected shipping method becomes unavailable.
